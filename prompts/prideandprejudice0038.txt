Mr. and Mrs. Bennet discuss the news that Netherfield Park has been let to a wealthy young man from up north. The passage describes Mr. Bennet's reaction to his wife's suggestion that they visit Mr. Bingley, a wealthy single man who is moving into the neighborhood. Mr. Bennet is not interested in meeting Mr. Bingley, but his wife insists that they do so. Mr. Bennet is over scrupulous and is preventing Mr. Bingley from marrying one of his daughters. He is concerned that they are all silly and ignorant, but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters. Mr. Bennet is an odd mixture of quick wit, sarcasm, and caprice, something his wife has not been able to understand fully after 23 years. Mrs. Bennet is a woman of low intelligence and bad temper. Their main goal in life is to get their daughters married off. When Mr. Bennet unexpectedly announces he is going to visit Mr. Bingley, Elizabeth is the only one who knows why. The passage discusses Mr. Bingley and whether or not he will be introduced to Mrs. Long. It is concluded that Mrs. Bennet will not do the introducing because she does not know him well enough herself. The girls' father will take it upon himself to decline Mr. Bingley's acquaintance after Mrs. Bennet declares she is sick of him. The passage describes Mr. Bennet's reaction to his wife's news that their girls had met a new young man. He is pleased and amused, and predicts that the man will soon be asking one of them to dance. His wife and daughters then try to get more information about him from Mr. Bennet, but he is evasive. Lady Lucas reports that Bingley is young, handsome, and agreeable, and that he plans to attend the next assembly with a large party. Mrs. Bennet is pleased at the prospect of one of her daughters marrying Bingley, and an invitation to dinner is dispatched. However, Bingley must go to town the following day and is unable to accept. Mr. Bingley arrives in Hertfordshire and is quickly followed by rumors that he is bringing a large party of twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the ball. Upon his arrival, it is revealed that he has only brought six people with him. Mr. Bingley is a good-looking man with easy manners, while his sisters are fashionable women. His brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, looks like a gentleman, and his friend Mr. Darcy is a tall and handsome man who quickly catches the attention of the room. Mr. Darcy is a wealthy man who is considered to be very handsome, but he is also very proud and arrogant. He spends most of the evening at a ball walking around the room, and people hope he will not return. Mrs. Bennet is one of the people who strongly dislikes him. The passage describes Mr. Darcy's conversation with Mr. Bingley about the Bennet sisters. Mr. Darcy is not interested in dancing with any of the Bennet sisters, but Mr. Bingley finds them all very pleasant and pretty. Mr. Darcy is rude to Elizabeth and she is not pleased. Mr. Bennet is up late, reading, when his wife comes home from a ball. She reports that Jane was much admired and danced twice with Mr. Bingley. Mr. Bennet is pleased to hear this. Mrs. Bennet is delighted with Mr. Bingley, who she thinks is very handsome, and his sisters, who she thinks are charming women. However, she cannot stand Mr. Darcy, who she thinks is a very disagreeable, conceited man. Jane agrees with her mother about Mr. Bingley, and expresses admiration for him. This passage discusses Elizabeth's surprise at being complimented by a young man, and her friend's observations about her tendency to see the good in everyone. The passage describes the sisters of a man that the speaker likes. The speaker thinks they are proud and conceited, but notes that they are still pleasant to talk to. Mr. Bingley inherited property from his father and intended to purchase an estate, but did not live to do it. His sisters were very anxious for him to have an estate of his own. Mr. Bingley was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at Netherfield House and took it immediately. Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of great opposition of character. Darcy and Bingley have very different opinions of the people they meet at the Meryton assembly. Bingley find everyone pleasant and pretty, while Darcy finds them uninteresting and unattractive.

Lady Lucas was a kind woman, and their eldest daughter was a sensible young woman whom Elizabeth liked. The Miss Lucases and Miss Bennets meet to discuss a ball, and Mrs. Bennet mentions that Mr. Bingley seemed to prefer Jane to any of the other girls. Charlotte then tells her about overhearing a conversation between Mr. Darcy and Mr. Robinson, in which Mr. Darcy says that Jane is the prettiest girl in the room. This passage discusses Mr. Darcy's perceived rudeness at a ball, with Miss Bingley claiming he is much more agreeable among his intimates. Mrs. Long says he said nothing to her at the ball, and Jane speculates that it may be because Mrs. Long does not have a carriage. Miss Lucas says she would not mind if he did not talk to her, but she wishes he had danced with Elizabeth. The passage discusses pride and how it is often mistaken for vanity. Pride is a feeling of self-satisfaction, while vanity is caring what others think of us. The passage also includes a conversation between Mrs. Bennet and her son Lucas, in which Lucas says he would drink a bottle of wine every day if he were as rich as Mr. Darcy. Mrs. Bennet tells him that if she saw him doing that, she would take away his bottle. The ladies of Longbourn visit the ladies of Netherfield, and it is evident that Mr. Bingley admires Jane. Jane is pleased by this, and Miss Lucas agrees that it is a good thing that Jane is not likely to be suspected by the world of being in love. The passage discusses how women should act around the men they are interested in. It is better for a woman to show more interest than she actually feels, as this will give the man encouragement. The passage discusses a plan for Jane to marry a rich husband, and Elizabeth agrees that it is a good idea if that is what Jane wants. However, Elizabeth points out that Jane does not yet know enough about the man to be certain of her feelings. Charlotte wishes Jane well. This passage discusses the idea that happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance. The author argues that it is better to know as little as possible about the defects of the person you are going to spend your life with. The author also observes that Mr. Darcy, who initially thought Elizabeth was not pretty, began to find her more attractive after he realized that she was intelligent and had expressive eyes. Mr. Darcy begins to take notice of a woman who he previously thought to be uninteresting. He admires her figure and her playful demeanor, and starts to wish he knew more about her. When he overhears her talking to a friend, he is amused by her impertinence and decides to speak to her. The lady in the passage is reluctant to play and sing for others, but does so anyway. Her sister Mary is eager to display her own talents and takes over the instrument after a few songs. The passage describes a group of people dancing at a party.

The passage describes the excitement of two young women at the arrival of a militia regiment in their neighborhood. They learn the officers' names and connections and visit them often. Mr. Bennet tells his wife that he thinks their two youngest daughters are uncommonly foolish, and Mrs. Bennet responds that he should not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother. Miss Bingley sends a note to Miss Bennet, asking her to come have dinner so they can avoid quarrelling. The passage describes Mrs. Bennet's happiness at the prospect of her daughter, Jane, being stranded at the home of her wealthy suitor, Mr. Bingley, due to bad weather. Mrs. Bennet is happy that her plan to make it rain has worked, as it will keep Elizabeth at Netherfield with Mr. Bingley. However, Mr. Bennet jokingly says that he only hopes Elizabeth does not become seriously ill or die as a result of the cold weather. Elizabeth is worried about her sister and decides to walk to Netherfield to check on her, even though she does not know how to ride a horse.

Last chunk: “This was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!” said Mrs. Bennet, more       than once, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own.       Till the next morning, however, she was not aware of all the       felicity of her contrivance. Breakfast was scarcely over when a       servant from Netherfield brought the following note for       Elizabeth:        “MY DEAREST LIZZY,—       “I find myself very unwell this morning, which, I suppose, is to       be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday. My kind friends       will not hear of my returning home till I am better. They insist also       on my seeing Mr. Jones—therefore do not be alarmed if you should       hear of his having been to me—and, excepting a sore throat and       headache, there is not much the matter with me.—Yours, &c.”        “Well, my dear,” said Mr. Bennet, when Elizabeth had read the       note aloud, “if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of       illness—if she should die, it would be a comfort to know that it       was all in pursuit of Mr. Bingley, and under your orders.”        “Oh! I am not at all afraid of her dying. People do not die of little       trifling colds. She will be taken good care of. As long as she       stays there, it is all very well. I would go and see her if I       could have the carriage.”        Elizabeth, feeling really anxious, was determined to go to her,       though the carriage was not to be had; and as she was no       horsewoman, walking was her only
