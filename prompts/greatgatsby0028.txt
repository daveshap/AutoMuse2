The passage describes a desolate area of land known as the valley of ashes, where ashes take the form of houses and chimneys and where ash-grey men move dimly through the powdery air.Occasionally a line of grey cars crawls along an invisible track, and the ash-grey men swarm up with leaden spades and stir up an impenetrable cloud. But above the grey land and the drifting dust, you can see the blue and gigantic eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg. Tom Buchanan's mistress lived in a small, yellow brick building on the edge of a waste land. One afternoon, Tom took his friend to meet her. The friend was not interested in meeting her, but Tom was insistent. The building contained three shops, one of which was for rent. George B. Wilson is the owner of a struggling garage. When Tom and the narrator enter, Wilson seems hopeful that they will buy a car. Tom is unimpressed by the garage and tells Wilson that he may take his business elsewhere.

But immediately she turned sharply from the window and, leaning forward, tapped on the front glass.  “I want to get one of those dogs,” she said earnestly. “I want to get one for the apartment. They’re nice to have—a dog.”  We backed up to a grey old man who bore an absurd resemblance to John D. Rockefeller. In a basket swung from his neck cowered a dozen very recent puppies of an indeterminate breed.  “What kind are they?” asked Mrs. Wilson eagerly, as he came to the taxi-window.  “All kinds. What kind do you want, lady?”  “I’d like to get one of those police dogs; I don’t suppose you got that kind?”  The man peered doubtfully into the basket, plunged in his hand and drew one up, wriggling, by the back of the neck.  “That’s no police dog,” said Tom.  “No, it’s not exactly a police dog,” said the man with disappointment in his voice. “It’s more of an Airedale.” He passed his hand over the brown
