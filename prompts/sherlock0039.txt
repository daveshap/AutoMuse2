Story so far:  The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes by Arthur Conan Doyle is a free eBook that can be used by anyone in the United States with very few restrictions. The eBook is updated regularly and is available in English. Sherlock Holmes was not a man who felt emotion, except for one woman: Irene Adler. He respected her for her intelligence and ability to read people, but their relationship was never romantic. Sherlock Holmes is still living in Baker Street and is still interested in crime. Watson sees him one night and they catch up. Sherlock Holmes deduces that Watson has gained weight and gone into practice again, based on his appearance. The passage describes how Sherlock Holmes deduces various things about a person based on their appearance. He explains that it is simple to do once you know how, but that most people are baffled by the process. A man receives a note asking him to meet a masked visitor at 8:15 to discuss a matter of great importance. The man has no idea what the meeting could be about. The passage discusses a note written on paper that is strong and stiff, with a peculiar texture. The paper is from Bohemia, and the note was written by someone who is likely well-to-do. A man enters who is very tall with a muscular build. He is richly dressed. A man wearing a mask enters and Holmes deduces that he is from Bohemia. The man introduces himself as the Count Von Kramm. A man who wishes to remain anonymous visits Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, asking them to swear to secrecy for two years and promising that at the end of that time, the matter will be of no importance. The man explains that the matter involves the great House of Ormstein, hereditary kings of Bohemia, and that it has the potential to grow into a scandal that could seriously damage the family's reputation. The passage describes a meeting between Sherlock Holmes and a man who later reveals himself to be the King of Bohemia. The King explains that he is seeking Holmes's help in a delicate matter concerning a woman named Irene Adler. The King of Bohemia has hired Sherlock Holmes to retrieve some compromising letters that he wrote to a young woman. However, the woman refuses to sell them or return them, and several attempts to steal them have failed. The speaker's employer has been threatened by Irene Adler, who has a compromising photograph of the employer. Adler has said she will send the photograph to the employer's fiancée's family unless the employer breaks off the engagement. The speaker is sure that Adler has not sent the photograph yet, because she said she would do so on the day the engagement is publicly announced (next Monday). Holmes is hired by a king to find a missing photograph. He is given a large sum of money and the address of the person who has it. He plans to meet with Watson the next day to discuss the case. The speaker describes how Sherlock Holmes was able to transform himself from a drunken-looking groom into a respectable tweed-suited man. He notes that this was just one of Holmes's many amazing abilities with disguises. The speaker then recounts how Holmes spent his morning and what he did at the end of it. The narrator, in the guise of a groom out of work, observed the habits and home of Miss Irene Adler. He learned from the local stable hands that she had turned the heads of all the local men. A woman who lives quietly and sings at concerts is the subject of gossip among cab drivers. They know that she has a male visitor who is a lawyer, and they speculate about the nature of their relationship. The narrator is trying to decide whether to investigate the woman or the man. A hansom cab pulls up to Briony Lodge and a gentleman emerges. He is in a hurry and appears to be the man of whom the narrator has heard. He goes into the house and the narrator sees him through the window, pacing and talking excitedly. He comes out and gets into the cab, telling the driver to hurry. The driver of a landau pulls up and a woman gets in, telling him to hurry to the Church of St. Monica. A man is being chased by two people, one of whom is Irene Adler. He escapes by getting into a cab and telling the driver to take him to the Church of St. Monica. He arrives just in time to see Adler and the other person getting married. The passage describes a man's encounter with a couple who were about to be married. The man ended up being their witness, and the bride gave him a sovereign. The man then says that he needs to make his own arrangements, which are cold beef and a glass of beer. The speaker is telling the person they are speaking to that they must not interfere in what is about to happen, and that they will know what to do when the time comes. Holmes and Watson are planning to use a fire as a distraction to break into a house. Holmes will pose as a clergyman, and Watson will wait for his signal to throw an object through the window and raise the alarm. The passage describes the scene around a house, and Holmes observes that the recent marriage of the occupants makes the search for a photograph more complicated. He reasons that the woman most likely has the photograph in her own possession, rather than with her banker or lawyer. A lady steps out of her carriage and is immediately surrounded by a group of men who start fighting with each other. One of the men is Holmes, who is trying to protect the lady. He gets hit and falls to the ground. Irene Adler helps an injured man, even though she is being watched by Sherlock Holmes, who is trying to blackmail her. Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson set off a smoke bomb in order to distract a crowd and allow them to escape. A man is pretending to be injured and is carried into a woman's home. He knows she will try to save her most precious belongings in a fire, so he starts a fire and she grabs the photograph he is looking for. Someone has stolen a photograph from a house, and Sherlock Holmes is on the case. He and a companion will call on the house tomorrow morning to try to find the thief and retrieve the photograph. Irene Adler is married, and Sherlock Holmes is in hopes that she loves her husband, because it would spare the King of Bohemia all fear of future annoyance. The woman in the passage has left England, and the person she was speaking to (Sherlock Holmes) is surprised and disappointed. He had been hoping to get some information from her. Irene Adler is an actress who has masqueraded as a man before. She followed Sherlock Holmes to his home and then ran off to her husband. They are leaving because the king wronged them and they have a photograph to prove it. In the passage, Holmes is discussing with the King how a woman's wit has bested his plans. He seems to be impressed by the woman, and the King offers to reward him. Holmes requests the woman's photograph, and the King agrees. In the autumn of last year, Sherlock Holmes was in deep conversation with a very stout, florid-faced, elderly gentleman with fiery red hair. I was about to withdraw when Holmes pulled me abruptly into the room and closed the door behind me. The stout gentleman was Mr. Wilson, Holmes' partner and helper in many of his most successful cases. A man comes to Sherlock Holmes to tell him about a very strange series of events. It is not clear if a crime has been committed, but the story is very curious. The passage describes a man who is seeking Sherlock Holmes' help. The man is average-looking, except for his red hair and disgruntled expression. Holmes deduces from the man's appearance that he has done manual labor at some point. The speaker uses Mr. Jabez Wilson's physical appearance to deduce that he is a manual laborer, a Freemason, and has recently been to China. The passage describes a man's reaction to an advertisement seeking red-headed men for a job that pays 4 pounds a week. The man is incredulous and wonders what the job could entail. Holmes finds the whole situation amusing and encourages the man to tell his story. This passage describes a man's assistant, who is very good at his job but likes to take pictures in his spare time. The man says that he is willing to work for less than he is worth because he enjoys learning the business. The passage describes a man who is considering joining the League of the Red-headed Men. He is told that the vacancy is worth quite a fortune, and that there are more vacancies than there are men. He is also told that the trustees are at their wits end what to do with the money.

Last chunk: fault, but on the whole he’s a good worker. There’s no vice in him.”  “He is still with you, I presume?”  “Yes, sir. He and a girl of fourteen, who does a bit of simple cooking and keeps the place clean—that’s all I have in the house, for I am a widower and never had any family. We live very quietly, sir, the three of us; and we keep a roof over our heads and pay our debts, if we do nothing more.  “The first thing that put us out was that advertisement. Spaulding, he came down into the office just this day eight weeks, with this very paper in his hand, and he says:  “‘I wish to the Lord, Mr. Wilson, that I was a red-headed man.’  “‘Why that?’ I asks.  “‘Why,’ says he, ‘here’s another vacancy on the League of the Red-headed Men. It’s worth quite a little fortune to any man who gets it, and I understand that there are more vacancies than there are men, so that the trustees are at their wits’ end what to do with the money. If my hair would only change colour, here’s a nice little crib all ready for me to step into.’  “‘Why, what is it, then?’ I asked. You see, Mr. Holmes, I am a very stay-at-home man, and as my business came to me instead of my having to go to it, I was often weeks on end without putting my foot over the door-mat. In that way I didn’t know much of what was going on outside, and I was always glad of a bit of news.  “‘Have you never heard of the League of the Red-headed Men?’ he asked with his eyes open.  “‘Never.’  “‘Why, I wonder at that, for you are eligible
