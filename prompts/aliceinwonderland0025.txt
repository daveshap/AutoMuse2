Story so far:  Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is a novel by Lewis Carroll. It tells the story of Alice, who falls down a rabbit hole into a fantastical world populated by strange creatures. The novel features such classic scenes as the Mad Hatter's tea party and the Queen's croquet game. Alice gets bored sitting by her sister and sees a white rabbit with a pocket watch. She chases it and falls down a rabbit hole. Alice falls down a very deep well, and has plenty of time to look around as she falls. She sees that the well is filled with shelves and cupboards, and takes down a jar of orange marmalade. She wonders how far she has fallen and if she will ever reach the bottom. Alice is falling down a rabbit hole and wonders aloud about the different things she's passing. She wonders if she'll fall all the way through the earth and come out in Australia or New Zealand. Alice gets sleepy and continues to talk to herself. Alice falls asleep and dreams that she is talking to Dinah, her cat. In the dream, she asks Dinah if she has ever eaten a bat. Suddenly, Alice wakes up and finds herself in a long, dark hallway. She sees a small table with a golden key on it and tries to use the key to unlock one of the doors in the hallway, but it doesn't work. Alice is sad and wonders how she will ever get out of the hallway. Alice finds a door in a hall that is too small for her to fit through. She tries to open it with a key, but it does not work. She then finds a bottle on the table with a label that says "Drink Me." Alice finds a bottle labeled "Drink Me" and decides to take a sip. She shrinks down to ten inches tall and is excited to enter the garden through the small door. Alice is worried that she might go out like a candle, and wonders what she would be like then. She tries to imagine what a candle's flame looks like after the candle is blown out, but she can't remember ever having seen such a thing.

Alice decides to go into the garden, but she forgets the key and can't reach it. She gets tired and sits down to cry.

Alice tells herself to stop crying and that it's no use to pretend to be two people. She thinks that there's hardly enough of her left to make one respectable person. Alice finds a cake that makes her grow larger, and she uses it to reach a key that will allow her into the garden. Alice is planning to be kind to her feet by giving them new boots for Christmas, but she finds it difficult to do so. She eventually meets the White Rabbit, who is dressed splendidly. Alice meets a rabbit who is in a hurry and drops his gloves and fan. Alice picks them up and begins talking to the rabbit, but he runs away. Alice wonders if she has been changed overnight and tries to remember who she is. Alice is confused about who she is and wonders if she has been changed into someone else. She decides that if she is indeed someone else, she would rather stay down where she is than go upstairs. Alice is surprised to find herself shrinking, and even more surprised to find herself in the sea. She wonders if she can take the train back. Alice finds herself in a pool of tears, and meets a mouse. She wonders if the mouse knows the way out, and tries to ask it in English. The mouse doesn't seem to understand, but winks at her. Alice encounters a mouse who is terrified of cats. The mouse explains that his family has always hated cats, and he doesn't want to hear their name again. Alice meets a mouse who is afraid of cats and dogs. The mouse tells Alice its story, and then they all swim to shore. The animals on the bank are trying to figure out how to dry off, and the Mouse takes charge. The Mouse explains that the best way to dry off is to listen to a story. The story is about William the Conqueror. The Mouse is telling the Duck about how the archbishop found it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him the crown. However, the Duck interrupts and does not seem to understand what the Mouse is saying. The passage describes a race in which everyone wins and Alice is chosen to give out the prizes. Alice finds a box of comfits and hands them out as prizes. The Mouse insists that Alice should have a prize too, so the Dodo presents her with a thimble. They all eat the comfits, and then the Mouse tells them his story. The Mouse tells Alice a story, but gets angry and walks away before finishing. Alice and the others beg the Mouse to come back and finish the story, but it refuses. Alice talks to a Lory and a Crab about her pet cat, Dinah. The mention of Dinah's predilection for catching and eating birds causes a stir among the other animals, who all hurry off. Alice is left alone, wondering if she will ever see her cat again. The White Rabbit is looking for his fan and gloves, and Alice tries to help. The Rabbit gets angry and tells Alice to go get them, so she runs off. Alice finds a house with a brass plate that says "W. Rabbit" and goes in. She finds a room with a fan and gloves and picks them up. She also finds a bottle and drinks from it. Alice drank from a magic bottle and grew until she was too large for the room. She was uncomfortable and wished she could go home.

Last chunk: did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected: before she had drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling, and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken. She hastily put down the bottle, saying to herself “That’s quite enough—I hope I shan’t grow any more—As it is, I can’t get out at the door—I do wish I hadn’t drunk quite so much!”  Alas! it was too late to wish that! She went on growing, and growing, and very soon had to kneel down on the floor: in another minute there was not even room for this, and she tried the effect of lying down with one elbow against the door, and the other arm curled round her head. Still she went on growing, and, as a last resource, she put one arm out of the window, and one foot up the chimney, and said to herself “Now I can do no more, whatever happens. What _will_ become of me?”  Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect, and she grew no larger: still it was very uncomfortable, and, as there seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room again, no wonder she felt unhappy.  “It was much pleasanter at home,” thought poor Alice, “when one wasn’t always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about by mice and rabbits. I almost wish I hadn’t gone down that rabbit-hole—and yet—and yet—it’s rather curious, you know, this sort of life! I do wonder what _can_ have happened to me! When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied that kind of thing never happened, and
