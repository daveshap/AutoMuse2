Story so far:  The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes by Arthur Conan Doyle is a free eBook that can be used by anyone in the United States with very few restrictions. The eBook is updated regularly and is available in English. Sherlock Holmes was not a man who felt emotion, except for one woman: Irene Adler. He respected her for her intelligence and ability to read people, but their relationship was never romantic. Sherlock Holmes is still living in Baker Street and is still interested in crime. Watson sees him one night and they catch up. Sherlock Holmes deduces that Watson has gained weight and gone into practice again, based on his appearance. The passage describes how Sherlock Holmes deduces various things about a person based on their appearance. He explains that it is simple to do once you know how, but that most people are baffled by the process. A man receives a note asking him to meet a masked visitor at 8:15 to discuss a matter of great importance. The man has no idea what the meeting could be about. The passage discusses a note written on paper that is strong and stiff, with a peculiar texture. The paper is from Bohemia, and the note was written by someone who is likely well-to-do. A man enters who is very tall with a muscular build. He is richly dressed.

And here he comes, if I am not mistaken, to resolve all our doubts.”  As he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses’ hoofs and grating wheels against the curb, followed by a sharp pull at the bell. Holmes whistled.  “A pair, by the sound,” said he. “Yes,” he continued, glancing out of the window. “A nice little brougham and a pair of beauties. A hundred and fifty guineas apiece. There’s money in this case, Watson, if there is nothing else.”  “I think that I had better go, Holmes.”  “Not a bit, Doctor. Stay where you are. I am lost without my Boswell. And this promises to be interesting. It would be a pity to miss it.”  “But your client—”  “Never mind him. I may want your help, and so may he. Here he comes. Sit down in that armchair, Doctor, and give us your best attention.”  A slow and heavy step, which had been heard upon the stairs and in the passage, paused immediately outside the door. Then there was a loud and authoritative tap.  “Come in!” said Holmes.  A man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six inches in height, with the chest and limbs of a Hercules. His dress was rich with a
