Story so far:  This is a Project Gutenberg eBook of Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen. It is available for free online and can be reused under the Project Gutenberg License. Mr. and Mrs. Bennet discuss the news that Netherfield Park has been let to a wealthy young man from up north. The passage describes Mr. Bennet's reaction to his wife's suggestion that they visit Mr. Bingley, a wealthy single man who is moving into the neighborhood. Mr. Bennet is not interested in meeting Mr. Bingley, but his wife insists that they do so. Mr. Bennet is over scrupulous and is preventing Mr. Bingley from marrying one of his daughters. He is concerned that they are all silly and ignorant, but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters. Mr. Bennet is an odd mixture of quick wit, sarcasm, and caprice, something his wife has not been able to understand fully after 23 years. Mrs. Bennet is a woman of low intelligence and bad temper. Their main goal in life is to get their daughters married off. When Mr. Bennet unexpectedly announces he is going to visit Mr. Bingley, Elizabeth is the only one who knows why. The passage discusses Mr. Bingley and whether or not he will be introduced to Mrs. Long. It is concluded that Mrs. Bennet will not do the introducing because she does not know him well enough herself. The girls' father will take it upon himself to decline Mr. Bingley's acquaintance after Mrs. Bennet declares she is sick of him. The passage describes Mr. Bennet's reaction to his wife's news that their girls had met a new young man. He is pleased and amused, and predicts that the man will soon be asking one of them to dance. His wife and daughters then try to get more information about him from Mr. Bennet, but he is evasive. Lady Lucas reports that Bingley is young, handsome, and agreeable, and that he plans to attend the next assembly with a large party. Mrs. Bennet is pleased at the prospect of one of her daughters marrying Bingley, and an invitation to dinner is dispatched. However, Bingley must go to town the following day and is unable to accept. Mr. Bingley arrives in Hertfordshire and is quickly followed by rumors that he is bringing a large party of twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the ball. Upon his arrival, it is revealed that he has only brought six people with him. Mr. Bingley is a good-looking man with easy manners, while his sisters are fashionable women. His brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, looks like a gentleman, and his friend Mr. Darcy is a tall and handsome man who quickly catches the attention of the room. Mr. Darcy is a wealthy man who is considered to be very handsome, but he is also very proud and arrogant. He spends most of the evening at a ball walking around the room, and people hope he will not return. Mrs. Bennet is one of the people who strongly dislikes him. The passage describes Mr. Darcy's conversation with Mr. Bingley about the Bennet sisters. Mr. Darcy is not interested in dancing with any of the Bennet sisters, but Mr. Bingley finds them all very pleasant and pretty. Mr. Darcy is rude to Elizabeth and she is not pleased. Mr. Bennet is up late, reading, when his wife comes home from a ball. She reports that Jane was much admired and danced twice with Mr. Bingley. Mr. Bennet is pleased to hear this.

Last chunk: the principal inhabitants. They found Mr. Bennet still       up. With a book he was regardless of time; and on the present       occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an       evening which had raised such splendid expectations. He had       rather hoped that all his wife’s views on the stranger would be       disappointed; but he soon found that he had a very different story       to hear.        “Oh, my dear Mr. Bennet,” as she entered the room, “we have had a       most delightful evening, a most excellent ball. I wish you had       been there. Jane was so admired, nothing could be like it.       Everybody said how well she looked; and Mr. Bingley thought her       quite beautiful, and danced with her twice. Only think of _that_,       my dear; he actually danced with her twice; and she was the only       creature in the room that he asked a second time. First of all,       he asked Miss Lucas. I was so vexed to see him stand up with her;       but, however, he did not admire her at all; indeed, nobody can,       you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going       down the dance. So he enquired who she was, and got introduced,       and asked her for the two next. Then, the two third he danced with       Miss King, and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth       with Jane again, and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the       _Boulanger_—”        “If he had had any compassion for _me_,” cried her husband       impatiently,
