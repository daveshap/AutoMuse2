Story so far:  Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is a novel by Lewis Carroll. It tells the story of Alice, who falls down a rabbit hole into a fantastical world populated by strange creatures. The novel features such classic scenes as the Mad Hatter's tea party and the Queen's croquet game. Alice gets bored sitting by her sister and sees a white rabbit with a pocket watch. She chases it and falls down a rabbit hole. Alice falls down a very deep well, and has plenty of time to look around as she falls. She sees that the well is filled with shelves and cupboards, and takes down a jar of orange marmalade. She wonders how far she has fallen and if she will ever reach the bottom. Alice is falling down a rabbit hole and wonders aloud about the different things she's passing. She wonders if she'll fall all the way through the earth and come out in Australia or New Zealand. Alice gets sleepy and continues to talk to herself. Alice falls asleep and dreams that she is talking to Dinah, her cat. In the dream, she asks Dinah if she has ever eaten a bat. Suddenly, Alice wakes up and finds herself in a long, dark hallway. She sees a small table with a golden key on it and tries to use the key to unlock one of the doors in the hallway, but it doesn't work. Alice is sad and wonders how she will ever get out of the hallway. Alice finds a door in a hall that is too small for her to fit through. She tries to open it with a key, but it does not work. She then finds a bottle on the table with a label that says "Drink Me." Alice finds a bottle labeled "Drink Me" and decides to take a sip. She shrinks down to ten inches tall and is excited to enter the garden through the small door. Alice is worried that she might go out like a candle, and wonders what she would be like then. She tries to imagine what a candle's flame looks like after the candle is blown out, but she can't remember ever having seen such a thing.

Alice decides to go into the garden, but she forgets the key and can't reach it. She gets tired and sits down to cry.

Alice tells herself to stop crying and that it's no use to pretend to be two people. She thinks that there's hardly enough of her left to make one respectable person. Alice finds a cake that makes her grow larger, and she uses it to reach a key that will allow her into the garden. Alice is planning to be kind to her feet by giving them new boots for Christmas, but she finds it difficult to do so. She eventually meets the White Rabbit, who is dressed splendidly. Alice meets a rabbit who is in a hurry and drops his gloves and fan. Alice picks them up and begins talking to the rabbit, but he runs away. Alice wonders if she has been changed overnight and tries to remember who she is. Alice is confused about who she is and wonders if she has been changed into someone else. She decides that if she is indeed someone else, she would rather stay down where she is than go upstairs. Alice is surprised to find herself shrinking, and even more surprised to find herself in the sea. She wonders if she can take the train back. Alice finds herself in a pool of tears, and meets a mouse. She wonders if the mouse knows the way out, and tries to ask it in English. The mouse doesn't seem to understand, but winks at her. Alice encounters a mouse who is terrified of cats. The mouse explains that his family has always hated cats, and he doesn't want to hear their name again. Alice meets a mouse who is afraid of cats and dogs. The mouse tells Alice its story, and then they all swim to shore. The animals on the bank are trying to figure out how to dry off, and the Mouse takes charge. The Mouse explains that the best way to dry off is to listen to a story. The story is about William the Conqueror. The Mouse is telling the Duck about how the archbishop found it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him the crown. However, the Duck interrupts and does not seem to understand what the Mouse is saying. The passage describes a race in which everyone wins and Alice is chosen to give out the prizes.

Last chunk: be a Caucus-race.”  “What _is_ a Caucus-race?” said Alice; not that she wanted much to know, but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that _somebody_ ought to speak, and no one else seemed inclined to say anything.  “Why,” said the Dodo, “the best way to explain it is to do it.” (And, as you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter day, I will tell you how the Dodo managed it.)  First it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, (“the exact shape doesn’t matter,” it said,) and then all the party were placed along the course, here and there. There was no “One, two, three, and away,” but they began running when they liked, and left off when they liked, so that it was not easy to know when the race was over. However, when they had been running half an hour or so, and were quite dry again, the Dodo suddenly called out “The race is over!” and they all crowded round it, panting, and asking, “But who has won?”  This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought, and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its forehead (the position in which you usually see Shakespeare, in the pictures of him), while the rest waited in silence. At last the Dodo said, “_Everybody_ has won, and all must have prizes.”  “But who is to give the prizes?” quite a chorus of voices asked.  “Why, _she_, of course,” said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with one finger; and the whole party at once crowded round her, calling out in a confused way, “Prizes! Prizes!”
