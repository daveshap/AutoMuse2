PROMPT:

Summarize this passage very concisely:

Passage: certainly shall not run away, now that you have asked me to stop. You dont really mind, Basil, do you? You have often told me that you liked your sitters to have some one to chat to.  Hallward bit his lip. If Dorian wishes it, of course you must stay. Dorians whims are laws to everybody, except himself.  Lord Henry took up his hat and gloves. You are very pressing, Basil, but I am afraid I must go. I have promised to meet a man at the Orleans. Good-bye, Mr. Gray. Come and see me some afternoon in Curzon Street. I am nearly always at home at five oclock. Write to me when you are coming. I should be sorry to miss you.  Basil, cried Dorian Gray, if Lord Henry Wotton goes, I shall go, too. You never open your lips while you are painting, and it is horribly dull standing on a platform and trying to look pleasant. Ask him to stay. I insist upon it.  Stay, Harry, to oblige Dorian, and to oblige me, said Hallward, gazing intently at his picture. It is quite true, I never talk when I am working, and never listen either, and it must be dreadfully tedious for my unfortunate sitters. I beg you to stay.  But what about my man at the Orleans?  The painter laughed. I dont think there will be any difficulty about that. Sit down again, Harry. And now, Dorian, get up on the platform, and dont move about too much, or pay any attention to what Lord Henry says. He has a very bad influence over all his friends, with the single exception of myself.  Dorian Gray stepped up on
