Summarize this passage very concisely:

Passage: The passage explains the terms of use for the Project Gutenberg eBook of The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne. The eBook is free to use for anyone in the United States, with few restrictions. Those outside of the United States must check their local laws before using the eBook. The author of The Scarlet Letter was surprised and amused to find that his sketch of official life in the preface to the second edition had caused an unprecedented amount of excitement among the respectable people around him. He insists that he did not mean to offend anyone and that the sketch was simply meant to be a frank and accurate portrayal of his impressions of the characters described therein. The author of "The Custom House" republishes his introductory sketch without changes, noting that he believes he has done so in the best possible way. The contents of the book are then listed. The passage describes the different illustrations in the book. The narrator talks about how he twice felt the need to write about his life, once when he was living in the Old Manse, and now again. He talks about how he has always been reticent to talk about himself, but feels compelled to do so now. The author talks about his experience working in a custom house, and how he feels that he has to keep a part of himself hidden from the world. The passage describes the author's reasons for writing a "Custom-House sketch" (an autobiographical account of how he came to possess the material for his book) and for assuming a personal relationship with the reader. He explains that he wants to provide a representation of a way of life that has not been described before, and that he hopes the sketch will serve as proof of the authenticity of the book's contents. The passage describes a building with a large American eagle on it. The eagle looks threatening, but many people still seek shelter under its wing.
