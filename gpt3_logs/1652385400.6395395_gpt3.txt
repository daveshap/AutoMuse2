Passage: I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men       of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood.        It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you       will not visit them.        Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will       visit them all.

Observing his second       daughter employed in trimming a hat, he suddenly addressed her       with,        I hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy.
