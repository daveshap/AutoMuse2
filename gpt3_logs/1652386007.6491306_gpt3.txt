Passage: think about officers any more than we do.       I remember the time when I liked a red coat myself very welland,       indeed, so I do still at my heart; and if a smart young colonel,       with five or six thousand a year, should want one of my girls, I       shall not say nay to him; and I thought Colonel Forster looked       very becoming the other night at Sir Williams in his       regimentals.        Mamma, cried Lydia, my aunt says that Colonel Forster and       Captain Carter do not go so often to Miss Watsons as they did       when they first came; she sees them now very often standing in       Clarkes library.        Mrs. Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman       with a note for Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and the       servant waited for an answer. Mrs. Bennets eyes sparkled with       pleasure, and she was eagerly calling out, while her daughter       read,        Well, Jane, who is it from? What is it about? What does he say?       Well, Jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love.        It is from Miss Bingley, said Jane, and then read it aloud.        MY DEAR FRIEND,       If you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with Louisa       and me, we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest       of our lives, for a whole days _tte--tte_ between two women       can never end without a quarrel. Come as soon as you can on the       receipt of this. My brother and the gentlemen are to dine
