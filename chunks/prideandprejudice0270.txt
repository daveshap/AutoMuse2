unprincipled or unjust—anything that spoke him of irreligious or       immoral habits; that among his own connections he was esteemed       and valued—that even Wickham had allowed him merit as a brother,       and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his       sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling; that had       his actions been what Mr. Wickham represented them, so gross a       violation of everything right could hardly have been concealed       from the world; and that friendship between a person capable of       it, and such an amiable man as Mr. Bingley, was incomprehensible.        She grew absolutely ashamed of herself. Of neither Darcy nor       Wickham could she think without feeling she had been blind,       partial, prejudiced, absurd.        “How despicably I have acted!” she cried; “I, who have prided       myself on my discernment! I, who have valued myself on my       abilities! who have often disdained the generous candour of my       sister, and gratified my vanity in useless or blameable mistrust!       How humiliating is this discovery! Yet, how just a humiliation!       Had I been in love, I could not have been more wretchedly blind!       But vanity, not love, has been my folly. Pleased with the       preference of one, and offended by the neglect of the other, on       the very beginning of our acquaintance, I have courted       prepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away, where either       were concerned.
