the pure and disinterested       desire of an establishment, cared not how soon that establishment       were gained.        Sir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their       consent; and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity. Mr.       Collins’s present circumstances made it a most eligible match for       their daughter, to whom they could give little fortune; and his       prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair. Lady Lucas       began directly to calculate, with more interest than the matter       had ever excited before, how many years longer Mr. Bennet was       likely to live; and Sir William gave it as his decided opinion,       that whenever Mr. Collins should be in possession of the       Longbourn estate, it would be highly expedient that both he and       his wife should make their appearance at St. James’s. The whole       family, in short, were properly overjoyed on the occasion. The       younger girls formed hopes of _coming out_ a year or two sooner       than they might otherwise have done; and the boys were relieved       from their apprehension of Charlotte’s dying an old maid.       Charlotte herself was tolerably composed. She had gained her       point, and had time to consider of it. Her reflections were in       general satisfactory. Mr. Collins, to be sure, was neither       sensible nor agreeable; his society was irksome, and his       attachment to her must be imaginary. But still he would be her       husband.
