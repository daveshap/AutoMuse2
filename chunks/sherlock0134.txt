two feet deep, so that the jury, having regard to his known eccentricity, brought in a verdict of ‘suicide.’ But I, who knew how he winced from the very thought of death, had much ado to persuade myself that he had gone out of his way to meet it.

Let me have the date of the reception by your uncle of the letter, and the date of his supposed suicide.”  “The letter arrived on March 10, 1883. His death was seven weeks later, upon the night of May 2nd.”  “Thank you.
