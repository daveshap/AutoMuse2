him.  “What’s up, then?” asked Holmes with a twinkle in his eye. “You look dissatisfied.”  “And I feel dissatisfied. It is this infernal St. Simon marriage case. I can make neither head nor tail of the business.”  “Really! You surprise me.”  “Who ever heard of such a mixed affair? Every clue seems to slip through my fingers. I have been at work upon it all day.”  “And very wet it seems to have made you,” said Holmes laying his hand upon the arm of the pea-jacket.  “Yes, I have been dragging the Serpentine.”  “In Heaven’s name, what for?”  “In search of the body of Lady St. Simon.”  Sherlock Holmes leaned back in his chair and laughed heartily.  “Have you dragged the basin of Trafalgar Square fountain?” he asked.  “Why? What do you mean?”  “Because you have just as good a chance of finding this lady in the one as in the other.”  Lestrade shot an angry glance at my companion. “I suppose you know all about it,” he snarled.  “Well, I have only just heard the facts, but my mind is made up.”  “Oh, indeed! Then you think that the Serpentine plays no part in the matter?”  “I think it very unlikely.”  “Then perhaps you will kindly explain how it is that we found this in it?” He opened his bag as he spoke, and tumbled onto the floor a wedding-dress of watered silk, a pair of white satin shoes and a bride’s wreath and veil, all discoloured and soaked in water. “There,” said he, putting a new wedding-ring upon the top of the pile. “There is a little nut for you to crack, Master Holmes.”
