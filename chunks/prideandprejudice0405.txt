among his former friends, there are       still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army. He       has the promise of an ensigncy in General ——’s regiment, now       quartered in the North. It is an advantage to have it so far from       this part of the kingdom. He promises fairly; and I hope among       different people, where they may each have a character to       preserve, they will both be more prudent.
