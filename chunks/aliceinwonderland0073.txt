the Gryphon, and the constant heavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle. Alice was very nearly getting up and saying, “Thank you, sir, for your interesting story,” but she could not help thinking there _must_ be more to come, so she sat still and said nothing.  “When we were little,” the Mock Turtle went on at last, more calmly, though still sobbing a little now and then, “we went to school in the sea. The master was an old Turtle—we used to call him Tortoise—”  “Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn’t one?” Alice asked.  “We called him Tortoise because he taught us,” said the Mock Turtle angrily: “really you are very dull!”  “You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question,” added the Gryphon; and then they both sat silent and looked at poor Alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth. At last the Gryphon said to the Mock Turtle, “Drive on, old fellow! Don’t be all day about it!” and he went on in these words:  “Yes, we went to school in the sea, though you mayn’t believe it—”  “I never said I didn’t!” interrupted Alice.  “You did,” said the Mock Turtle.  “Hold your tongue!” added the Gryphon, before Alice could speak again. The Mock Turtle went on.  “We had the best of educations—in fact, we went to school every day—”  “_I’ve_ been to a day-school, too,” said Alice; “you needn’t be so proud as all that.”  “With extras?” asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously.  “Yes,” said Alice, “we learned French and music.”  “And washing?” said the Mock Turtle.
