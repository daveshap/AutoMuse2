Till this moment I never knew myself.”        From herself to Jane—from Jane to Bingley, her thoughts were in a       line which soon brought to her recollection that Mr. Darcy’s       explanation _there_ had appeared very insufficient, and she read       it again. Widely different was the effect of a second perusal.       How could she deny that credit to his assertions in one instance,       which she had been obliged to give in the other? He declared       himself to be totally unsuspicious of her sister’s attachment;       and she could not help remembering what Charlotte’s opinion had       always been.
