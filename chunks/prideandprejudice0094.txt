Collins repeated his apologies in quitting the       room, and was assured with unwearying civility that they were       perfectly needless.        As they walked home, Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen       pass between the two gentlemen; but though Jane would have       defended either or both, had they appeared to be in the wrong,       she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister.        Mr. Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs. Bennet by       admiring Mrs. Phillips’s manners and politeness. He protested       that, except Lady Catherine and her daughter, he had never seen a       more elegant woman; for she had not only received him with the       utmost civility, but even pointedly included him in her       invitation for the next evening, although utterly unknown to her       before. Something, he supposed, might be attributed to his       connection with them, but yet he had never met with so much       attention in the whole course of his life.     Chapter 16        As no objection was made to the young people’s engagement with       their aunt, and all Mr. Collins’s scruples of leaving Mr. and       Mrs. Bennet for a single evening during his visit were most       steadily resisted, the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at       a suitable hour to Meryton; and the girls had the pleasure of       hearing, as they entered the drawing-room, that Mr. Wickham had       accepted their uncle’s invitation, and was then in the house.
